# Analyzing the risk of becoming diabetic using Data Science

![example_pic](pics/intro_pic.png)


##  Project Motivation:

Based on the Cross Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), [the diabetes dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) was analysed to predict whether a patient is diabetic, given his metabolic data like glucose level, BMI etc.

We aimed to answer the following questions-
1. Do people with high Glucose level are more vulnerable to diabetes?
2. There is a general notion that overweight people are at high risk of diabetes. Is it true?
3. Are elder people more prone to diabetes?
4. Is diabetes generally hereditary?
5. Does the number of pregnancies experienced increase the risk of getting diabetes?


##  Summary of the methodology
* Performed exploratory data analysis
* Computed salient statistical measures and plotted relevant graphs
* Imputed the missing data
* Processed the features using StandardScaler
* Trained the data using Logistic Regression and computed feature importance
* Reported the performance of the model using various classification metrics
